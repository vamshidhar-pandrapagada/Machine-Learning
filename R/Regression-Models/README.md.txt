# Regression-Models

As part of this project , we review the data set of a collection of cars we are interested in and explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). During the intial analysis it is evident that (i.e a model fit between Transmission and mpg), manual vehicles have 7.24 more MPG than
automatic vehicles. But after fitting multiple regression models, we have deduced the following conclusions:  

1. Even though intial observation suggested that Manual vehicles have higher mileage than Automatic, MPG
as an outcome is dependent on other features in the car.
2. This is done by rejecting the NULL Hypothesis and accepting the alternate hypothesis by including other
variables in the model.
3. Automatic/Manual trasmission provides only the correlation. Causation, as indicated is dependent on
other predictors.
